In this assignment, you will be creating a dynamic checkerboard. The checkerboard will allow users to pass their desired height and width and display a checkerboard to match those requirements. For example:

### Objectives:
* Implementing JSPs

* Implement static files (Web Containers Lesson)

### Tasks:
* Allow the user to pass the height and width via query parameters and draw a checkerboard accordingly.

* Have your JSP handle the query parameters directly. You do not need to create a servlet.

* Use an external CSS file. Do not use inline or internal styling.

* Check the values of the query parameters inside of your JSP file.
